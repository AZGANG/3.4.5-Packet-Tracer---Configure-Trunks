# 3.4.5-Packet-Tracer---Configure-Trunks
Configure Trunks
Objectives
Part 1: Verify VLANs

Part 2: Configure Trunks

Background
Trunks are required to pass VLAN information between switches. A port on a switch is either an access port or a trunk port. Access ports carry traffic from a specific VLAN assigned to the port. A trunk port by default is a member of all VLANs. Therefore, it carries traffic for all VLANs. This activity focuses on creating trunk ports and assigning them to a native VLAN other than the default.
